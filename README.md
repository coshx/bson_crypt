# bson_crypt

## Description

The goal of bson_crypt is to provide a minimally-intrusive solution to encrypt the values in a mongo document.
While this provides a layer of protection against attackers, it still leaks information about the structure of data, and we recommend it be used in conjunction with encrypted transport layers as well as an encrypted filesystem.

## Status

This is still a work in progress, and is not ready for consumtion.
